# Automation

A talk I did for a Redbrick Wednesday Event in 2018. The link to the slides is found, should have speaker notes attatched.

There's some scripts, found below, Redbrick often uses and these scripts are referenced in the talk, and can even be used in a demo if needs be. dcurooms is my script, it's not on the Redbrick Github.
