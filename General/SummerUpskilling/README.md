# Summer: A Redbrick Guide To Upskilling


A talk I did for a RedbricK Wednesday near the end of semester two in the 2017-18 year. The link to the slides is found below.

Talk uses some prolog, haskell, nasm, go and ruby scripts to showcase the different languages.
I'll add further info on running these scripts soon.
